## Context and Problem Statement

As we develop GitFairy, we need to establish a comprehensive testing strategy and quality assurance approach to ensure the reliability, correctness, and maintainability of our codebase. This decision addresses the selection of testing frameworks, methodologies, and tools that will be used throughout the development lifecycle.

We need to ensure our testing approach is compatible with our primary programming language (Rust) and the Tauri framework, while providing adequate coverage for both backend and frontend components. Since we're building a desktop application with Tauri UI rather than a web server, our testing approach should reflect this architecture.

## Decision Drivers

* Compatibility with Rust and the Tauri framework
* Support for testing both backend (Rust) and frontend (TypeScript/HTML/CSS) components
* Ability to perform unit, integration, and end-to-end testing
* Performance impact on development workflow and CI/CD pipeline
* Ease of use and learning curve for contributors
* Coverage reporting and quality metrics
* Minimal reliance on mocks, favoring real implementations when possible
* Support for property-based and fuzz testing for robust validation
* Lightweight and modern tooling with fast execution times
* Support for testing against a containerized Git server for integration tests

## Considered Options

* **Rust Testing Stack**: Rust's built-in testing framework + proptest + cargo-tarpaulin
* **Modern Lightweight Stack**: Rust's built-in testing + Vitest + Playwright + cargo-tarpaulin
* **Traditional JS Testing Stack**: Rust's built-in testing + Jest + Cypress + cargo-tarpaulin
* **Minimal Testing Approach**: Only use language-native testing tools with minimal external dependencies

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Modern Lightweight Stack", because it provides excellent coverage with modern, fast tools that are well-suited for a Tauri application while minimizing reliance on mocks.

### Consequences

* Good, because Vitest offers significantly faster execution than Jest for frontend component testing
* Good, because Playwright provides reliable cross-platform E2E testing with better performance than Cypress
* Good, because it minimizes reliance on mocks in favor of real implementations
* Good, because it supports containerized Git server testing for realistic integration tests
* Good, because it offers comprehensive coverage reporting
* Good, because it aligns with modern frontend testing practices
* Bad, because it may require additional setup for Tauri-specific testing scenarios
* Bad, because some tools are newer and may have less community support than established alternatives

### Confirmation

Implementation will be verified by:

1. Minimum test coverage thresholds (80% for critical components)
2. CI/CD pipeline integration of all testing tools
3. Documentation of testing practices and examples
4. Regular review of test quality and coverage metrics
5. Successful integration tests against a containerized Git server

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Rust Testing Stack

* Good, because it's well-integrated with the Rust ecosystem
* Good, because it has minimal external dependencies
* Good, because it provides property-based testing via proptest
* Good, because it avoids unnecessary mocking
* Bad, because it lacks specialized frontend testing capabilities
* Bad, because E2E testing for the Tauri UI would be more difficult to implement

### Modern Lightweight Stack

* Good, because Vitest is significantly faster than Jest (up to 20x in some cases)
* Good, because Playwright offers better cross-platform support and performance than Cypress
* Good, because it uses modern tools designed for speed and developer experience
* Good, because it can test against real Git server implementations in containers
* Good, because it minimizes the need for mocks
* Bad, because some tools are newer with potentially less documentation
* Bad, because it may require custom integration with Tauri

### Traditional JS Testing Stack

* Good, because it uses well-established tools with extensive documentation
* Good, because it has a large community and ecosystem
* Good, because it provides thorough testing capabilities
* Bad, because Jest is significantly slower than modern alternatives like Vitest
* Bad, because Cypress has higher resource requirements than Playwright
* Bad, because it often encourages heavy use of mocks

### Minimal Testing Approach

* Good, because it's simple to set up and maintain
* Good, because it has the lowest learning curve
* Good, because it integrates well with language-native tooling
* Bad, because it may miss important testing scenarios
* Bad, because it lacks specialized testing capabilities for complex UI components
* Bad, because it may not adequately test Tauri-specific functionality
