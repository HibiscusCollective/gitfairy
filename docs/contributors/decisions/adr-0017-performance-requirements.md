## Context and Problem Statement

We need to establish performance requirements that ensure GitFairy remains responsive while respecting upstream API limitations.
The solution must provide reliable benchmarking without compromising user privacy.

## Decision Drivers

* Performance parity with native git
* API rate limit compliance
* Automated benchmarking
* Resource monitoring
* Performance testing
* Opt-in telemetry
* Performance profiling
* Resource optimization
* Caching strategies
* Load testing

## Considered Options

* Automated Performance Testing with CI/CD Integration
* Manual Performance Testing
* Cloud Performance Testing
* Real User Monitoring

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Automated Performance Testing with CI/CD Integration", because it provides consistent, reproducible performance metrics while maintaining control over testing environments and privacy considerations.

### Consequences

* Good, because it ensures consistent performance measurement across development cycles
* Good, because it automates detection of performance regressions
* Good, because it respects user privacy by not requiring production monitoring
* Good, because it integrates with existing CI/CD pipelines
* Bad, because it requires additional infrastructure setup and maintenance
* Bad, because synthetic tests may not fully represent real-world usage patterns

### Confirmation

Implementation will be confirmed through:
* Successful integration of performance tests in CI/CD pipeline
* Establishment of performance baselines for key operations
* Regular performance regression testing
* Validation that performance targets are consistently met

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### Automated Performance Testing with CI/CD Integration

* Good, because it provides consistent, reproducible results
* Good, because it integrates with existing development workflows
* Good, because it enables early detection of performance issues
* Bad, because it requires additional infrastructure setup
* Bad, because synthetic tests may not fully represent real-world usage

### Manual Performance Testing

* Good, because it has a simple setup with no automation needed
* Good, because it provides direct feedback from real-world usage
* Good, because it offers flexible testing scenarios
* Bad, because it produces inconsistent, hard-to-reproduce results
* Bad, because it is time-consuming and resource-intensive
* Bad, because it supports only limited testing scenarios

### Cloud Performance Testing

* Good, because it enables scalable testing across multiple scenarios
* Good, because it provides a consistent testing environment
* Good, because it generates detailed, automated metrics
* Bad, because it introduces additional costs
* Bad, because it requires complex setup
* Bad, because it may have network variance affecting results
* Bad, because it may raise privacy concerns with external services

### Real User Monitoring

* Good, because it captures actual usage data from diverse environments
* Good, because it provides real-world metrics and usage patterns
* Good, because it enables detection of issues in production
* Bad, because it raises significant privacy concerns
* Bad, because it may introduce data bias
* Bad, because it requires complex implementation
* Bad, because it has limited control over testing conditions

## More Information

### Performance Targets

* Git operations: â‰¤ 110% of native git time
* UI updates: < 16ms (60fps)
* Memory usage: < 200MB baseline
* CPU usage: < 10% idle state

### Implementation Details

#### Benchmarking Framework

```rust
use criterion::{criterion_group, criterion_main, Criterion};
use std::process::Command;

pub fn git_benchmark(c: &mut Criterion) {
    let mut group = c.benchmark_group("git_operations");
    
    // Benchmark native git
    group.bench_function("native_git_status", |b| b.iter(|| {
        Command::new("git")
            .arg("status")
            .output()
            .expect("Failed to execute git")
    }));
    
    // Benchmark GitFairy
    group.bench_function("gitfairy_status", |b| b.iter(|| {
        gitfairy::git::status()
            .expect("Failed to get status")
    }));
    
    group.finish();
}

criterion_group!(benches, git_benchmark);
criterion_main!(benches);
```

#### API Rate Limiting

```rust
use std::time::{Duration, Instant};
use tokio::sync::Semaphore;

#[derive(Debug)]
pub struct RateLimiter {
    semaphore: Semaphore,
    window: Duration,
    last_reset: Instant,
    requests_per_window: u32,
}

impl RateLimiter {
    pub async fn acquire(&self) -> Result<(), Error> {
        let permit = self.semaphore.acquire().await?;
        if self.last_reset.elapsed() > self.window {
            self.reset().await;
        }
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

#### CI/CD Test Configuration

```yaml
performance:
  environments:
    - name: "small_repo"
      files: 1000
      commits: 1000
    - name: "medium_repo"
      files: 10000
      commits: 5000
    - name: "large_repo"
      files: 50000
      commits: 10000
  
  operations:
    - name: "status"
      max_time: 500ms
    - name: "fetch"
      max_time: 2s
    - name: "push"
      max_time: 5s
    
  metrics:
    - cpu_usage
    - memory_usage
    - response_time
    - throughput
```

### Resource Management Strategies

1. __Lazy Loading__
   - Load repository data on demand
   - Unload inactive repositories
   - Cache frequently accessed data
   - Implement LRU caching

2. __Resource Limits__
   - Maximum concurrent operations
   - Repository size thresholds
   - Cache size limits
   - Memory usage caps

3. __Garbage Collection__
   - Automatic cache cleanup
   - Temporary file removal
   - Memory defragmentation
   - Resource reclamation

### Performance Monitoring

1. __Benchmark Suite__
   - Git operation timing
   - UI responsiveness
   - Memory profiling
   - CPU utilization

2. __Resource Tracking__
   - Memory allocation
   - File handles
   - Network connections
   - Cache utilization

3. __Optimization Targets__
   - Cold start time
   - Operation latency
   - Memory footprint
   - Network efficiency

4. __Testing Scenarios__
   - Repository sizes
   - Operation types
   - Network conditions
   - Concurrent operations
